# Simple-CI
Stateless. Infinite scalability. Easy Setup. Microservice. Minimalist CI

This is designed to be simple, and minimalistic. Current open source CI systems are overly complex, and requires much effort to setup, use and manage. I built this to allow anyone to setup and use CI in their infrastructure without much effort.

Please read my first [design doc](simple-ci.pdf) for this project to learn more.
